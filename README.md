Purchase receipt
I have completed a mini-project - a shopping calculator,
/ Without using objects
/ Used arrays for practice
/ The code is built on functions, arrays, and loops
/ Used a rendering function to display the list
/ Created the ability to add a new product using 3 inputs and an add button
/ Used a function to calculate the total cost in case of an increase in the quantity of items or the removal of li
/ There is the ability to edit information about an existing product using the edit button and prompt
/ There is the ability to delete a product from the list.
